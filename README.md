# Data description

**1. 205species**  
This folder includes TD-, WGD- and HGT-derived genes, gene families, and *Ks* values of TD-derived gene pairs in each of 205 studied species.

**2. Ancestral_and_specific_TD_events**  
Ancestral and independent TD events in *Arabidopsis thaliana*, *Schrenkiella parvula*, *Oryza sativa* and *Zizania latifolia*. The TD events that occurred before and after the divergence of *A. thaliana* and *S. parvula*, as well as *O. sativa* and *Z. latifolia*, were considered ancestral and specific TD events, respectively.

**3. Biotic_stress**  
List of upregulated genes in *Arabidopsis thaliana* and *Oryza sativa* and under biotic stresses, such as *Botrytis cinereal*, *Colletotrichum tofieldiae*, flg22, *Heterodera schachti* nematodes, *Heterodera schachtii* parasitism, *Pseudomonas syringae*, *Rhizobium* sp, and *Verticillium dahlia* on *Arabidopsis thaliana* and *Meloidogyne incognita*, *Magnaporthe oryzae*, *Azospirillum brasilense*, Soil microbiome, *Hirschmanniella oryzae*, *Rhizophagus irregularis*, *Burkholderia vietnamiensis* and *Paraburkholderia kururiensis* on *Oryza sativa*. 

**4. GLM_analysis**  
The details of the species geographical coordinates, climatic, anthropogenic, edaphic, and plant morpho-ecospace variables, and the GLM analysis results of 1000 bootstrap resampling replicates.

**5. GO_enrichment**  
The GO term annotations for 28 representative species and enriched terms of TD- and WGD-derived family genes.

**6. MLtree**  
The original phylogenetic tree files for the ten TD-derived families. The phylogenetic trees were constructed using 17 representative plants, including Rhodophytes (*Galdieria sulphuraria* and *Gracilariopsis chorda*), Prasinodermophyta (*Prasinoderma coloniale*), Chlorophytes (*Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* and *Chloropicon primus*), Charophytes (*Klebsormidium nitens* and *Mesotaenium endlicherianum*), Bryophytes (*Marchantia polymorpha* and *Anthoceros angustus*), Lycophytes (*Isoetes taiwanensis* and *Selaginella moellendorffii*), Ferns (*Adiantum capillus-veneris* and *Alsophila spinulosa*), Gymnosperms (*Torreya grandis* and *Pinus lambertiana*), and Angiosperms (*Arabidopsis thaliana* and *Oryza sativa*). 

**7. Mangroves**  
The details of 15 mangrove genomes. You can obtain gene lists of TD-derived genes, gene families, and *Ks* values of TD-gene pairs in each mangrove species form this folder.

**8. Code**  
The code used in this study, including 'HGTdetector.sh' and other scripts.
